                    <small>Company History</small>
               <p>Cookie Crumble was created in 2012 by Nimra Shakoor, Adam Mair, and Cierra Harris in Baltimore, Maryland. The birth of the idea happened during Christmas eve. Traditionally, we would all pitch in to make cookies for our Christmas parties. At this one Christmas party in 2012, we had experimented with unique flavor combinations 
	not normally used to make cookies. Once these cookies were introduced to our families, the reaction was wholeheartedly positive. We realized afterwards that these cookies could be extremely popular throughout the East Coast, and currently, we have expanded to various retail stores in Maryland, Pennsylvannis, and Deleware.
